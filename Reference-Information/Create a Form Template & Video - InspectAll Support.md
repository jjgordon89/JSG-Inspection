Create a Form Template & Video

Introduction

Forms are generally created just like the assessments, audits, inspections, and checklists that are already being

used by your company. Forms will be added to folders and scheduled to, or added by, your mobile users to fill out.

They will be the source of all of the valuable information that will be converted into reports.  Here's a quick video and

some instructions on how to get started:
