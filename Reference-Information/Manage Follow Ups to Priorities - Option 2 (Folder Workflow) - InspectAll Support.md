Manage Follow Ups to Priorities - Option 2 (Folder

Workflow)

Overview

InspectAll allows you to follow a priority from finding to resolution.  The following instructions detail another great

option in managing the resolution of priorities found on an inspection form, for example, and following it through to

the service call/repair stage.

You can accomplish this workflow in three easy steps.

Step 1 - Reschedule the completed inspection folder to the user(s) for the repairs.

Step 2 - Change the Folder Type to Service Call / Repair (or whatever folder type you are using to schedule

your service work). (Optional)

Step 3 - Mobile Users will filter the form to show priorities and mark them as resolved as they are

addressed/corrected.

Step 1 - Reschedule the completed inspection folder to the

user(s)

From the Website, Edit Schedule within a Folder:

1. Navigate to the individual folder from anywhere within the application.
2. Click on the Schedule tab (with the calendar).

5- Then click on "Update Folder"

Step 3 - Filter and Resolve Priorities from the Mobile App

You can resolve priorities within a Folder on the Mobile app.  Just tap on the form with Priorities, and go into any

questions where priorities have been found.  You can do a FILTER by PRIORITIES first if you want, to get right to

the list of questions where a low, medium, or high priority has been marked.
