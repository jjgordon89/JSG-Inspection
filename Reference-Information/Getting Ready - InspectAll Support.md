Core Components

There are a few moving parts to understand as you get started with InspectAll. Those parts include forms, accounts,

folders, assets, and contacts. So, let’s get started.

 Folders

Folders help you organize your forms into a process that works for your company. Folders can be scheduled to

specific user or you can add folders to your own schedule from the mobile app. Either way, you’ll be able to create a

workflow that fits your company.

 Forms

Forms capture the answers and responses to questions you've setup. Forms are generally all you need to collect

data for assessments, audits, inspections, and checklists that you would normally fill out on paper.

 Accounts

Accounts represent the companies, customers, facilities, and departments that you’re working with in InspectAll.

There's no limit to the number of accounts that you can create.

 Assets

Assets are pieces of equipment, persons, buildings, or tools that you want to track over time. Examples of assets

include Fall Protection Equipment, Generators, Vehicles, Employees and more.

 Reports

Reports take all of the data that you've collected and aggregate it into a PDF, XLS, or DOC file that you can

download or email. You'll be able to run reports on your folders, forms, and assets.

Go to Create your first account (6-your-first-account).
