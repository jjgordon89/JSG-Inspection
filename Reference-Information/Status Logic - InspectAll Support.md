Status Logic

Asset Status Logic

Asset Status Logic allows you to edit your forms to change the status

of an asset based on your answer to a question on a form.

Here’s an example of how Asset Logic works

Question 1:  Has crane reached end of design life, requires assessment for suitability for continued safe use as per

AS2550.3?

If you select “Yes”, then then the STATUS of the asset for which you are completing the form will CHANGE to "Out

of Service".

If you select “No” then the status will remain the same as it was when you started the form.

Here's how to set it up

To use Asset Status Logic on a form, go to your form template in form builder, and click on the blue edit pencil on the

question that you want to determine the asset status.

This question type must be a single select question type to use Asset Logic.

For example, “Has crane reached end of design life, requires assessment for suitability for continued safe use as

per AS2550.3?”

Within the question, click on "Conditional Logic"

Then click on "Add Status Logic".

In this example, when "yes" is selected, the asset will change to "Out of Service" for a status.
