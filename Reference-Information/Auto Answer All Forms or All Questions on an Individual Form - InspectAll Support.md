Auto Answer All Forms or All Questions on an

Individual Form

There may be instance where your process requires you to only find exceptions or priorities without individually

going through every question in a folder.

For such situations we have a feature called "Pencil Whipping".  With this Auto Answer feature, you have an option

to either auto answer every unanswered question on every uncompleted form in a folder that have default answers

setup for them, or auto answer all questions on an individual form for which default answers have been set up.

Again, tapping this button automatically answers each question that meets all of the following:

Has a default answer (//docs.inspectall.com/article/537-set-a-default-answer)

Is unanswered

Is on a Form that is marked "Incomplete"

To Auto Answer all Forms in a folder (currently iOS only):

1. Tap the menu while in a folder.
2. Tap Auto Answer All Forms:
3. Confirm and watch it do it's job:
