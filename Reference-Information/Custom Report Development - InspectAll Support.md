Custom Report Development

Overview

InspectAll offers lots of great reporting options right out of the box.

But what if you want an Insights report with additional information or parameters?  Or you want a folder report that

offers some analytic data or additional images or sections?  No problem!  With InspectAll professional services, we

can develop a report to your specifications.

Contact Us (http://www.inspectall.com/contact) with the details and we will provide you with a quote.

We will need the following information to get started

Type of Report (Form report, Folder Report, Insights report, Quote report)

Optimized Output (PDF, Word, or Excel)

What Folder Type(s) or Form Template(s) do you want this report available for?

Scope (Give us all the details...if you want something to populate on the report based on a certain question or

answer, let us know.  The more specifics you can provide, the quicker we can get the report completed.)

Mock Up (Show us what you want...just provide a mock up example that gives us an idea of what you want the

final report output to look like.)

Example Folder or example parameters. If you are having a report built that pulls from a folder or a date

range, provide us with an example Folder or Account so that we can test the report as we build.

Once you've provided us with the details, we will give you a quote and a timeline to complete the project.  If you

approve, we get started and in no time you have an awesome, personalized and proprietary report.
