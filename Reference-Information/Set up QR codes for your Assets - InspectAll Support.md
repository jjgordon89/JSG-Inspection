Set up QR codes for your Assets

QR Codes in InspectAll

Overview

QR Codes are a great way to easily find assets while on site.

If you tag assets with these QR codes, you will be able to walk up to the asset, click on the bar code icon (in a folder

or under assets) from your mobile, and get right to the asset form you're looking for from either the Account

Menu/Assets or from within a Folder where forms for that asset reside.  Think of the QR code as another way to

identify your assets or search for them.

Note:  QR codes only work to ID an asset within your account.  They are not designed to allow anyone scan them

and retrieve information outside of users on your account.

We've found that the easiest way to set up these barcodes for the first time, is to tag them on site from the mobile

app and scan the code from there.

Before you get started, you will want to assign one of the ID fields as "QR Code" for the class of assets you are

tagging.  You can give the field any title, but just ensure you are using one of the two ID fields to store the

information. More information on Asset ID fields can be found HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/573-asset-id-

fields)

Print QR Codes from the InspectAll website

Go to the Insights Tab on the web

Click beside the "Assets QR Code Tag" on the "Download Reports" icon.

Enter in a Prefix (we recommend something that will distinguish the customer you are setting up.  For example,

for the account "TLC Cranes", use "TC" as the prefix.)

Enter a starting and ending value in increments of 15.  Fifteen tags will print per page.

Click download report.  Then print the page.

The labels are formatted to print on Avery rugged tags 6578. You can utilize most any other QR code generator you

prefer if you want a different format than the one supplied.

Assign QR Codes to your Assets

You can pre-assign codes on the web by using ID1 or ID2 (//docs.inspectall.com/article/573-asset-id-fields) or the

Description field under any asset class and entering the alpha-numeric code you set up on the stickers.  But the

following steps are a best practice we've seen many clients use successfully.

Bring your QR code stickers with you to the site

Before inspecting an asset, add a sticker to it.

Click on the ID field you are using for the QR code.

Click on the Bar Code icon to open your camera and scan the code
