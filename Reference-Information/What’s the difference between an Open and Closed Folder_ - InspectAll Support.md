What’s the difference between an Open and

Closed Folder?

Introduction

Distiguishing between folders that are open versus those that should be marked closed will go a long way in your

efforts to stay organized and on track. Folders that are Open should be incomplete and require more work to be

done in them. Folders that are Closed are considered complete or ready to be archived. The primary reason to

close a folder is to remove it from your pipeline of work that needs to be done.
