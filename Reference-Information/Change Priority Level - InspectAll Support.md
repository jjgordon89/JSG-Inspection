Change Priority Level

You are able to change a priority level for a question by either changing the default priority level for a pre-set answer

selection or manually updating the priority level within the question on a form.

Change the Default priority level for an answer selection

As an Admin, in Form Builder on the website, click into the form template you want to edit and Un-publish the form.

Once the form is un-published, click the blue pencil icon on a question that contains the answer selection list you

want to edit.

In the next screen, click on the blue pencil icon to edit the existing answer selection list. NOTE, editing the answer

selection list will update it on every question on every form you have this answer selection list set up on. More

Manually change the priority level for an answer on a Form

If you have answered a question on a form that has a default priority level assigned to it, you can also manually

adjust the priority level for that question. Just click a different priority option under the "Priority" section on the

question.
