From here you can select which will be the DEFAULT report when you download a folder report for this type. You

can select one of the standard reports, or if your account has a custom report, you can also chose that here.

Custom Report

If you have a custom report built for your account, and that is currently set as the default report for a folder type, you

can modify the cover page and settings for that folder report type by changing the default report to STANDARD,

saving that setting, then going back into the folder to make changes. Once the changes are saved, go back into the

folder and update the default type to your custom report.

Note: Reporting options for custom reports are not editable. Contact us (/contact) for any changes you need on

custom reports.
