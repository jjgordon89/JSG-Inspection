More Options to Customize your reports

Overview

You already know about all the helpful features you have to allow you to customize your folder report output right

from your access on the web (in Folder Settings).

Click Here to Learn how to customize your reports in Folder Settings. (//docs.inspectall.com/article/83-folder-setup)

But did you know that in addition to those options, there are also a few things we can do on the backend to modify

your report outputs without custom development?

Size and location of pictures.

You can have your pictures inline with the questions for which they were taken, or at the bottom of the report

with a notation that indicates for which section they were taken.

We can also increase the size of the pictures to 2 per line or 1 per line to make them larger.

What’s included in the attribute and header details of your report

We can add or remove certain information about the account, location, and area, who completed it and when, and

the number of attributes for asset tracking forms that are shown on the report.

What forms and questions are included on the report

Want to exclude forms without priorities for a report for certain folder types?  We are also able to set up your reports

to show all questions (answered or not) or to show only questions that have an answer input

Add a Static Page

Want to add another page after your cover sheet with some static information?  We can do that and input

information that won’t change from report to report (like a summary about your company, or contact information).

Add An Overview Page

The overview page is especially for asset tracking forms and provides you with a page after your cover sheet that

shows a summary of issues identified by asset class and location.

Add notes that will show up at the end of the report

If you have some notes that you want to show up at the end of each form on your report, let us know.  We can set

this static information to show up on every report by default.

If you want any of these changes made to your reports, just contact us at support@inspectall.com

(mailto:support@inspectall.com) or call your InspectAll rep for assistance.

And if you still want more, check out the Custom Report options in our Professional Services.  We can build a report

output to look any way you want!  https://docs.inspectall.com/article/335-professional-services

Show or Hide Resolution information

This function determines if the "Resolved" designator and notes on resolve priorities show on the reports. On Form

Reports, this function will allow you to show resolutions on specific Form Reports, but keep them hidden on the

folder report. On Folder Reports, this function is specific to the Folder Type so you can decide which folder types

you want to show this information on the folder report.

Show or Hide Form Notes, Question Definitions, and Form Instructions

By default the question specific "definition" field of your form templates, as well as the form "Instructions" do not

show on customer reports, but rather are designed to be internal instructions to your mobile users.  Additionally, you

have a Form Notes section on the mobile app that allows you to input "internal" notes that are specific to that form.

Both the definition and the form notes fields can be set to show up on the folder or form report output.
