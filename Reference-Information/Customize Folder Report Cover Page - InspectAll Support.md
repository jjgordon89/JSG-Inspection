You can insert any information from the drop down list that will automatically populate on the cover sheet of your

report.  This information will show up in brackets on the cover sheet content section in Folder Settings.  { }

For Dates, you can insert the Date Created or Date Closed (which will be based on when the folder was

created or closed).  Or if you want the cover sheet to show the date the report was printed, enter

"@Month/@Day/@Year".  Completed dates will show up on FORMS automatically.

Folder Type will pull the Name of the Folder Type into your report.  So, for instance, if you are doing an

Annual Inspection Folder type, that is the information that will show up where you insert the Folder Type

data.

If you want to be able to manually add information on the cover sheet, use the "Description" field.  The

description field pulls any information you enter in the Folder Description on a folder (from the website or

mobile app).

Edit font style, alignment, and size.

Click on the text box to edit the fields.
