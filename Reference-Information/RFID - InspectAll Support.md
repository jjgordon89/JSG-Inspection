RFID

InspectAll has supported RFID since the beginning.  There are still a few standard uses in General Industry that

make use of RFID tags.  While many of the external RFID readers are obsolete and no longer supported by their

manufacturers, the newest Apple iPhone devices make use of the same technology used by Apple Pay to allow

scanning of RFID tags without additional hardware.

How to Use It

Go to your Device Settings and search for InspectAll.

From within these device InspectAll settings, make sure that "Enable RFID" is turned on.

Use one of your Asset ID fields to record the RFID tag and tie it to an asset.  Look for the RFID icon above fields like

ID1 and ID2.  Tap the icon and then hold your device, with the back of the phone towards the tag in close proximity

to scan it.

Once you've recorded an RFID tag to an asset, you will be able to scan that tag within a folder to easily find the form

and asset you are looking for.
