Schedule One Folder

Introduction

Web users can schedule folders to mobile users, and mobile users can access those folders from anywhere. A

folder can be scheduled from the web to one user or to an entire team depending on how your department works.

Scheduling from the web isn't the only way to schedule folders! Mobile users can schedule new folders or edit their

existing schedule. Scheduling will go a long way to keeping your mobile device organized.

You can also allow users on the same team to SHARE a folder with another member of their team from their mobile

device.

To allow users to share folders from the mobile, they must be on the same TEAM.  You can create teams as an

admin, and users can be assigned to as many teams as they want. More about setting up TEAMS can be found

here:  https://docs.inspectall.com/article/99-team-setup (//docs.inspectall.com/article/99-team-setup)

1.  Once users are on the same team (and a sync is done after the team set up is complete), they will be able to
share a folder that is scheduled to them to another user on their team.

2.  Tap on the Folder tab to get to Folder Details
3.  Then down below the Schedule Details, they will see a list of other members of their team.  They can click on the
user they want to share with.  When they do a sync, and the other user does a sync, the folder will be shared.
