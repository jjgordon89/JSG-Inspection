Conditional Logic

Conditional Logic

Conditional Logic allows you to edit your forms to populate applicable questions

based on your answers to proceeding questions.

Here’s an example of how Conditional Logic works

Question 1:  Are there ladders on this jobsite?

If you select “Yes”, then the following question will populate:

Question 2:  What’s the Condition of the ladders?

If you select “No” then that question will not populate on the form.

Here's how to set it up

To use Conditional Logic on a form, go to your form template in form builder, and first create a question that will

determine if additional questions will populate on the form.

This question type must be a single select or multi-select question type to use Conditional Logic.

For example, “Are there ladders on this jobsite?”

Next, create all possible questions on your form template (those questions that you want to show up based on the

answer to your first single or multi-select question type).

For example, “What’s the condition of the ladders?”

Once you’ve created all the follow-up questions, go back to your first question (the question that when answered will

determine if additional questions will populate on the form) and click the “Edit” pencil.

You will see a blue link that reads, “Conditional Logic” above the answer selection list. Click that.

In the top section of the box that pops us, you will see “Question Logic”.  Click on the green "+Add Question Logic"

button.

In this instance, in the “If Selection” field, we will choose “Yes”, and the “Add/Remove” selection field, we will select

“Add”.

We are telling the form that “If Selection Yes” is chosen, then we want to “Add” the following question(s).

Then check the box next to the questions you want to show up.

Now click “Create Question Logic”.

Once you are done, click the blue “Save” button on the question to save the logic you created for the question.

Be sure to publish the form template once complete, and do a sync and update on your mobile device to see the

changes.
