Folder Description

Use your Folder Description Field. It's searchable!

The Description field on your folder is searchable, shows up as notes for your mobile user, and can even be added

to your reports if it's something you want your customer or the end-user to see.

Some of our clients' uses for Folder Description:

Customer PO number or Work order number

Description of service to be performed

Instructions to your inspectors

Confirmation of review

Internal Notes

Invoice number

Date of job ("July 2019 Fall Protection")
