Changing Locations of Forms, Assets, Folders

Change an asset location

Introduction

Locations allow you to further define where an asset is at an account.  The location is tied to the asset, but is also

noted on each asset tracking form you create.

To change an asset location, you can either change the location within the asset itself (on the web or mobile), thus

leaving the previously tagged location for the asset on all previously created forms, or change the location from

within the form (on the mobile or web), which will also change the location on the asset itself (but will NOT change

the location on previously created forms)

Changing the asset location from within the asset itself

* Click on the asset (on the web, in the assets tab, on the mobile, from the account > assets)
* Edit the asset
* Update the location
This action will change the location on the asset itself (for all future forms), but not on any forms that have already

been added to a folder or completed).

This action will change both the location on the form you are currently in, as well as change the location on the asset

itself for all future forms.  It will NOT change the location on previously created forms.

This action will update the location on all forms and assets within that folder.  It will not update the location on

previously created or completed forms outside of that folder.

Locations on Folders

If you create a folder and tag it with a location, it will automatically FILTER the assets by that location.  So you will

only see assets that are tagged with the same location on the mobile app when you go to select your asset forms.  If

you didn't mean to apply this filter, you can just remove the folder location to see all available assets for the account.
