Adding or Editing an Account

Introduction

Accounts represent the companies, customers, facilities, and/or departments that you plan to manage with

InspectAll.

In a typical "supplier to customer" scenario, an Account represents the customer. The Account Name and

Account ID would correspond to the customer name and customer number while the Address fields are typically

associated to the customer "bill to" address. Customer "ship to" names and numbers are often associated to

Location Names and IDs in InspectAll.

In a typical "in-house" scenario, an Account represents the facility name of unique business units for your company.

The Account Name and Account ID should correspond to unique departments or facilities for your company.
