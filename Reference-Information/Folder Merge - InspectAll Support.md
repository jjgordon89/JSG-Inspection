Folder Merge

The folder merge allows you to merge all forms in two folders from the InspectAll website.

How to Use it

On the InspectAll website, go into the folder you want to merge into another folder.

Click on "Merge" at the top right.

Enter the Folder ID you want to merge the folder into. Only folders in the same account are displayed.

Select the folder you would like to merge this folder into.

Click "Merge Folder"

NOTE!! - Merging a Folder into another Folder performs the following actions:

This will move every form in this Folder into the target Folder and mark this Folder "Deleted".

This will move every time punch (//docs.inspectall.com/article/439-introduction-to-time) in this Folder over to

the target Folder

This will only merge this Folder into the target Folder if both of them are under the same account. To move

the folder to another account, you will need to use the folder "MOVE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/743-

move-assets-to-another-account)" function.

This merge feature will not move over any schedules (//docs.inspectall.com/article/74-update-the-schedule)

from this Folder.

There is not an "undo" button for this function. If you merge two folders, to separate them again, you will

need to create a new folder, and manually move the forms (//docs.inspectall.com/article/51-can-i-move-

forms-between-folders) you want to separate to the other folder.
