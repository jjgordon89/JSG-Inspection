Priority Roll-Over Feature

Overview

The Priority Roll-over feature was developed for InspectAll clients who want to see an asset’s priorities identified on

the last inspection of a specific type, when filling out a new form.

You can also pull an Asset History report (//docs.inspectall.com/article/127-can-i-export-my-asset-history) on the

web, iOS, or Android mobile app to see previous priorities for an asset.

Here’s How it Works

Here’s an example: if you send a technician out to do an annual inspection on an overhead crane, and there was a

priority identified on the hoist the last time someone completed that annual inspection, the priority roll-over feature

will notify the inspector, right from the mobile device, of the priorities found on the hoist on the last annual

inspection.  They can then choose to import the priorities and comments into the existing form.

APPLE DEVICES

When you open a form where previous priorities were found for an asset, you will see a notification at the top of the

form.

You can choose to import all priorities into your new form by clicking on this “Previous Forms Found” notification.

Or, if you want to see the priorities specific to each question, just start the inspection.  And you will get a notification

at the bottom of your screen for any question where a priority was found on the last inspection of that type.

From here, you can choose to "Import," which will import the last answer and comments into the form you are

working in.  Or if you click "Cancel," the notification will disappear and you can answer the question manually.

ANDROID DEVICES

On the Android device, you will see a red dot a the top right of the screen when there is a notification about previous

priorities found. Tap on the down arrow.

WEBSITE

Here's how it works:

The Web version of priority roll over is FOLDER SPECIFIC or FORM SPECIFIC (instead of being based on the

asset like on the mobile app versions).  It allows a web or admin user to copy an existing folder or form and roll over

all priorities found within that folder to the new folder, or all answers from one folder to a new folder.

As an example, you send a technician out to do an annual inspection on an overhead crane, and there was a priority

identified on the hoist the last time someone completed that annual inspection, the priority roll-over feature allows

the web user to roll those priorities found on the hoist on the last annual inspection over to the new folder/forms so

the mobile user can see what happened last time.

FOLDER ROLL-OVER

To roll over all priorities from a previous folder follow these steps:

Note: Rolling over priorities only works when copying a form to the SAME asset. Priorities cannot be rolled over to a

new asset as the asset may have different questions based on the attribute exclusions that are set up for the class.

Details

Priority Roll-Over is currently available on the website to roll over questions marked with a priority for an

entire folder or an individual form, OR from iOS (Apple mobile devices) and Android to roll over individual

priorities, or all priorities on an asset tracking form, specific to the asset and not the folder.  More information on

the mobile option can be found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/557-priority-roll-over-feature).

Rolling over ALL answers from a previous folder or form is only available from the website.

From the Apple or Android mobile app, it requires internet access or cellular signal to work, as it is pulling

real time information.

For assets, it is form and asset specific.  If a priority was identified on an asset, then a new form of that

same type will show previously identified priorities regardless of the folder it is added to.  This feature is

currently only available from Apple mobile devices. (For instance, from one annual inspection to the next).

Forms will be copied exactly as they are (if questions have been added or removed on the form template, you

will have the option to refresh the questions on the form to show the changes)

For non-asset forms, it is account/folder specific as well as form specific.  If you copy a folder for an account,

you can choose to roll over the priorities from the last inspection.  And the copy feature will bring all priorities in

the last folder into the new folder, or all answers over from the previous folder depending on the option you

choose.

Only UN-RESOLVED priorities will roll over.  If a priority has been marked resolved anywhere on the web or

mobile app, it will not roll over.

Pictures and signatures do NOT roll over.

Resolution details/notes do NOT roll over.

You can choose to add this feature to your account for use on the Apple or Android mobile app.  If you do, all

Apple or Android device mobile users will have access.

Contact us at support@inspectall.com (mailto:support@inspectall.com) to have the feature added to your

account, or if you have additional questions.
