Manage Follow Ups to Priorities - Option 3 (One

Form Option)

Overview

Using the recently released Priority Roll over (//docs.inspectall.com/article/557-priority-roll-over-feature) feature,

setting up service calls can be done using the same form you use for inspections.

Complete instructions on setting up this option in your account can be found below.  We can also supply you with a

One Form Template that has this logic set up.  Keep in mind that if you have already been using the InspectAll

program, we recommend using an existing form template in your library. Admin users have access to complete this

set up in your account on the InspectAll website.  And you can do so at no additional cost.

Alternatively, if you would like the InspectAll team to set this option up for you, there is one-time charge of $500.  We

will work with you to update your form templates with the appropriate logic, and do one, half hour training session on

using the feature.  Contact Us  (http://www.inspectall.com/contact)for additional Details.

How it Works:

* Use a single form template for Annual Inspections, Monthly/Quarterly Inspections, and Service Calls.
* Use conditional logic to eliminate the appropriate questions for a less in depth monthly inspection.
* Use Priority Roll-over and see issues identified on Annual inspections when doing your monthlies, on Monthly
Inspections when doing your annuals, and on Service Calls for any outstanding item.

How to Set it Up:

First, Set up your Form Template in Form Builder

For Existing InspectAll clients who have been using the system for a while, we recommend using your Annual

Inspection form template and making the changes there.

Add a "service call" section.

You can add the questions you want to this section.  A snapshot of what our standard service form looks like is

below.

Add a "Follow Up" question.

Again, this question can be worded the way you want.  The intent is to have a single question that can be set up to

update your asset status when answered.  It also serves as an easy way to run insights and priorities reports and

see which assets require follow up.

After creating the follow up question and saving it, click on "Conditional Logic" in the question.

Type of Service or Inspection

Create a New Section and/or Question to indicate the type of inspection/service being performed.

After creating the Service/Inspection Type question (must be set up as a single select question type), set up your

conditional logic to determine what questions should be REMOVED when selecting "Monthly/Periodic" inspection

and "Annual" Inspection.  The idea here is to exclude questions for Monthly Inspections (out of those on the Annual

Inspection form template) that aren't inspection points executed during the less complex monthly or periodic

inspection.

Be sure to set up the logic to "Remove" the Service Call section whenever Monthly or Annual Inspection are

chosen.

Be sure to publish the form after making your changes.

Un-publish your service call form as well as the monthly and/or periodic inspection forms you were previously using.

Your new updated Annual Inspection form will be used for Annual and Monthly inspections, as well as Service Calls

moving forward.

How to Use it:

After creating your Folder, select your assets.  Use the filter to select only assets that are set at "Repair

Recommended" or "Repair Required" (if doing a service call).  If you've updated the assets on the previous

inspection, or utilized the follow up question with status logic, any asset marked as needing service on the last

inspection will have an updated status that corresponds.  If doing an inspection of any type, just chose all the assets

to inspect.

From the Website

1. Use Priority Roll Over (//docs.inspectall.com/article/726-priority-roll-over-from-the-website) to import your priorities
from the last inspection for that asset.  Using this One Form option, priorities identified on previous monthlies or

annuals will roll over.

Any priorities not marked as resolved will roll over to the next service or inspection form you do for the asset.
