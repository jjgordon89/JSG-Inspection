Asset Images for Offline Access

Each asset can have one image assigned to it. You can add images from mobile devices or upload them from our

web app.  Asset images are always available for reports and in our web app which requires internet.  Our mobile

apps are designed for offline access and have a few restrictions about what's available offline:

Offline Access

We design our mobile apps (iOS and Android) to be able to work seamlessly offline where no internet is available.

As images are "byte heavy" we have to limit the amount of images downloaded to the devices. We've implemented

the following logic for each device type to determine which images are downloaded:

iOS

When internet is available the app will go out and get the asset image.

When internet is not available only assets belonging to accounts that have folders scheduled for that day

are downloaded.  This means if you want to have access to a particular accounts asset images you'll need

to schedule a folder from that account to yourself or to the user that will be doing the inspections.

Android

When internet is available the app will go out and get the asset image.

Unlike iOS we do not download asset images for offline access. (not yet at least, this may be a feature we

add in future releases)
