Summary/Deficiency Reports

Introduction

There are several reports you can pull within InspectAll that will outline only the Priorities found (by Account, Asset,

Folder, or Date Range).  These priority reports are a great way to see only issues found during inspections.

You can also use Folder Settings to create a Folder type, that when selected, will only show priorities on your Folder

Report.

Priorities Reports

In InspectAll, all findings are categorized by the priority level assigned during an inspection.  You can assign a "Low,

Medium, or High" priority to any issue you find.  If no issue is found, a "Good" priority level is assigned, and if the

question isn't applicable, then an "N/A" priority will be assigned.

Utilizing these priority levels allows you to customize your folder reports, notifications, and also review priority

findings by account, folder, asset, or date range.

Read more about Priorities Reports by clicking here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/567-priorities-reports).

Create a Deficiency or Summary Folder Report

If you want to print a Folder Report that shows only deficiencies found during an inspection, you can do so by going

to "Folder Settings" on the Admin menu on the InspectAll website.

From here, you can create a new Folder Type and set up the report parameters to only show Priorities.

Details on setting up a folder type can be found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/83-folder-setup).

Be sure to click on the "Forms" tab of your folder settings to select which priority levels should show up on the

report.

In the next box, click on the "Folder Type" field.

Then select "Summary" or "Deficiency" Report.  Then click "I'm Done" and "Update Folder".

The folder type will now change to the new folder type.  Your other data won't be deleted, but any question that has

not been answered with the priority level you selected in folder set up will be excluded from the report that you

download.
