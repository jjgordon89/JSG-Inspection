Folder ID and System ID

What is a Folder ID?

The Folder ID is an automatically populated alpha-numeric identification for your folder.  Folder IDs are searchable

on the website and mobile app, and can even be set up to populate on the cover sheet of your Folder Report

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/626-customize-folder-report-cover-page).

The Folder SYTEM ID is a unique auto generated ID that cannot be edited. You can find the System ID for a folder

in the folder details. You are also able to search by this ID.

Set Up Folder IDs

Each Folder Type can be set up to auto-generate based on the prefix and counter you set.  That information can be

updated in Folder Settings.

As a best practice, we recommend giving your folder types unique prefixes to differentiate them from folder IDs

generated in other folder types.  Taking this step will make it easier when searching for a folder

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/84-search-for-a-folder)by ID.

Edit Folder ID

Folder IDs can also be manually updated by editing the ID after the folder is created on the website, or by entering a

unique ID at folder creation on the mobile app.  A  best practice for editing a Folder ID is to use a work order number

that correlates to another system generated number.

To edit a folder ID on the website, go into the Folder and click the blue pencil icon beside the existing ID. Edit the

Folder ID field and then click on the blue "Update Folder" button.

From the mobile app, when you create a new folder, it will auto-generate the Folder ID based on the prefix and

counter you have set for that type.  The folder ID is generated when you do your next sync.  Alternatively, when

creating the folder, you can manually enter an ID in that field.
