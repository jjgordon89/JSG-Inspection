Schedule a Folder

Introduction

Web users can schedule folders to mobile users, and mobile users can access those folders from anywhere! A

folder can be scheduled from the web to one user, or to an entire team, depending on how your department works.

Scheduling from the web isn't the only way to schedule folders. Mobile users can schedule new folders or edit their

existing schedule. Scheduling will go a long way to keeping your mobile device organized.
