Use Folder Types to Create a Workflow

Overview

Different workflows in InspectAll can be handled very efficiently by customizing your Folder Settings and creating

categories and Folder Types.

We suggest setting up a different folder type for each workflow. Since folder types can service as "labels" for the

work completed, they can be changed as a job moves to the next stage.

How Does it Work?

Let's say you have a Folder Category of INSPECTIONS.

Under that category, you may have different types of inspections, based on frequency, or the item inspected.

Your organization could look like this:

INSPECTIONS (Folder Category)

Annual Inspections

Quarterly Inspection

Monthly Inspections

Weekly Inspections

You can create a workflow to easily see where in the process a job is by creating additional Folder Categories with

the same Folder Types under each category.

TO BE BILLED (Folder Category)

Then, when you are done with an inspection, and have found priorities that require follow up for repair, you can

change the folder type so that they are now under the "REPAIRS" category.  Do the same when done with the

repairs so that your billing department knows what needs to be billed.

To change the folder type, simply click on the "Edit Folder" button in a folder, and choose a new type to send it to the

next "Stage" in your process.

You can do the same from the mobile app by clicking on the Folder Details and updating the Folder Type there.

How Do I Search for a Folder by Type?

Using this workflow allows any user to login on the web and easily access the jobs based on where it is in the

workflow.

For instance, if your job is invoicing, and you want to be able to quickly see what jobs need to be billed, just go to

the folder grid, and use your Folder Filters  (//docs.inspectall.com/article/84-search-for-a-folder)to see the jobs you

need to bill out.

How do I Create new Folder Types?

As an Admin user, you can login to the InspectAll website, and create or update your Folder Settings to manage

your folder types.

Just click on your name on the website, and select the "Folder Settings" option from the drop down menu.
