Close or Open a Folder

Introduction

When you have finished with a folder, you'll want to remove it from your work flow to make way for new tasks.

Folders that are Closed are considered complete or ready to be archived.

Closed folders on the mobile will be visibly marked so you can easily distiguish between all the great work you've

finished, and what still needs to be done.
