Clone an Asset

Introduction

Cloning an asset essentially makes a complete copy of that asset. Cloning an asset will eliminate the time wasted

on adding each asset individually. For instance, if your team inspects 50 cranes, you can add one crane, enter all of

the consistent information, and then clone the asset 49 times.

Most information entered into the cloned asset will be copied over to the new asset(s) including:

Location

Area

Asset Attributes

Description

Status

Urgent Note

A few things are not copied over when you clone an asset including:

ID1

ID2

Coordinates
