Introduction

Different workflows in InspectAll can be handled very efficiently by customizing your Folder Settings. We suggest

setting up a different folder type for each workflow. For example, if you plan to manage a Quality and Safety process

in InspectAll, you may choose to organize your folders in the following manner:

Quality (Folder Category)

Quality Assurance Checks (Folder Type)

Quality Control Measures (Folder Type)

Safety (Folder Category)

Hazard Assessments (Folder Type)

Inspections (Folder Type)

Accident Investigation (Folder Type)

Folders can be setup with the following characteristics:

Name & Color: Adds a name and color to every folder.

Default Report: the report template that will be used on the printed folder report.

Calculated Folder IDs: Setup a prefix and counter to add an id to each new folder automatically.

Default Forms: create a workflow of forms for the folders by automatically adding forms to every new folder.

Permissions: restrict teams from viewing particular folder types.

image file should be larger to cover the width of a standard piece of paper. Think about 7.5-8" (about 720

pixels). The cover page logo will automatically left align.

5. Edit content:
Click  Insert Folder Date  to add information fields to your cover page.

You can insert any information from the drop down list that will automatically populate on the cover sheet of

your report.  This information will show up in brackets on the cover sheet content section in Folder Settings.

{ }

For Dates, you can insert the Date Created or Date Closed (which will be based on when the folder was

created or closed).

Folder Type will pull the Name of the Folder Type into your report.  So, for instance, if you are doing an

Annual Inspection Folder type, that is the information that will show up where you insert the Folder Type

data.

If you want to be able to manually add information on the cover sheet, use the "Description" field.  The

description field pulls any information you enter in the Folder Description on a folder (from the website

or mobile app).

Edit font style, alignment, and size.

Click on the text box to edit the fields.

6. Click  Upload Footer  to select a file containing a custom footer. File types supported are .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif,
