Add an Asset

Introduction

Assets represent things such as pieces of equipment, persons, buildings, or tools that you want to track and

manage using InspectAll. Examples of assets include Fall Protection Equipment, Generators, Vehicles, Employees

for your Company, and much more.

When you fist try to add an asset, you will be asked to choose an Asset Type. This list of asset types will only

display what you have setup for your company. If there are no asset types setup, go setup your asset types first.
