Folder Notes (Internal Job Notes)

Folder Notes

Folder notes allow you to choose up to three fields, labeled how you want, to enter internal data for a Job Folder that

doesn't populate on your customer report.

Details

Each field has a character limit of 256 characters

To turn on Folder Notes, just email us at support@inspectall.com and let us know what you want the fields to be

called.

You can use these fields for job specific information such as purchase order numbers, work order numbers,

invoice numbers, or job specific contact information.

How to Use it

Folder notes can be entered at Folder Creation.  When you click on "Add Folder" from the website, your Folder Note

fields will populate, as well as the searchable open text Folder Description field.
