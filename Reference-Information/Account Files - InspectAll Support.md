Account Files

Overview

Account Files allow you to attach documents to an Account that are viewable from the InspectAll website and on iOS

and Android devices.

Some of the more common uses for these Account files are storing contracts or customer information that is on

documents outside of the InspectAll application or anything related to the Customer that you want to be able to

access in one place.  It's a great feature to help you organize your efforts and find related information quickly.

How to Use it

To use the Account File feature, simply go into the Account on the website, and click on the little green plus icon to

the left side.  When you click on the icon, your document window will populate allowing you to select the file you

want to attach from your computer.

After you select the file you want to add, it will show up under the "Files" section in your Account.  You can click on

the blue pencil icon to edit the file and rename it or add a description.
