API Integration

InspectAll is built on top of a well documented, modern, and efficient API (Application Programming Interface).  What

this means is that anything our app does can be programmed by you in any language of your choice and on any

platform of your choice.  We've had customers use our API to create apps which complement our platform, integrate

with other systems (such as ERPs, CRMs, and Customer Portals), or email to generate reports in their own reports

system.

If you're interested in using our API below is the link to our developers site which fully documents the API and all of

its capabilities. :

Be sure to review our Best Practices for Integrations  (//docs.inspectall.com/article/766-integration-best-

practices)article prior to starting development on your integration.

InspectAll offers access to the API free of charge to our clients.  We do not complete the integrations, so you will

want to hire a third party integration company.  Alternatively, for simple software integrations, you can use Zapier to

do the integrations yourself.

More information on Zapier integrations can be found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/474-integrate-using-zapier).
