Allow Duplicate Forms for the Same Asset in a

Folder

There is an option in form builder, that is form template specific, that allows you to prevent the same form template

from being added to a folder for the same asset. This option is a failsafe to prevent inadvertent duplication of a form

for an asset on the same job.

To manage this setting, go to Form Builder on the website under the Admin Menu.

Click the blue pencil "Edit" icon beside the form template you want to update.

Then check or uncheck the box that reads "Yes, allow duplicate types of this form per asset in the same folder."

If the box beside the line titled "Yes, allow duplicate types of this form per asset in the same folder." is checked then

you will be able to add duplicate forms to a folder. If it is unchecked, then a duplicate of a form template for the same

asset will not add to the folder when attempted.
