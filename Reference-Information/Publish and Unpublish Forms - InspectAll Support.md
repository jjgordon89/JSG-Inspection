Publish and Unpublish Forms

Introduction

Any forms your create on the web will only become available to mobile users once they are published. Leave, come

back, and make changes; your progress will be saved with InspectAll. An unpublished form can be edited and will

not display to mobile or web users. A published form can not be edited but will be available to all mobile and web

users (unless they are otherwise restricted through team permissions (99-team-setup)).
