Your First Asset

Introduction

Assets represent pieces of equipment, persons, buildings, or tools that you want to track over time. Assets can be

setup to capture the following information:

A Photo

Serial Number, Barcode, QR,  or any other scannable tag information

Custom Attributes (such as size or capacity)

Urgent Notes

Statuses

Once assets are created, you can create forms to guide your users through an inspection of the asset. The

information users collect will provide you with real time infomation on what is being done correctly and where there

is room for improvement.

Before you can add your first asset, you will need to setup and configure your asset types (148-organize-with-

categories-and-classes). Asset types are organized by categories and classes. For example, I may call my category

Fire Protection and Prevention and place the different types of equipment I want to track in a class inside that

category. Below I have a category called Fire Protection and Prevention with 4 different types of assets (or

classes) I want to track:

Fire Protection and Prevention

Portable Fire Extinguishers

Automatic Sprinkler Systems

Fire Extinguishing Systems

Detection and Alarm Systems

Once your asset types have been created, you can start adding your assets!
