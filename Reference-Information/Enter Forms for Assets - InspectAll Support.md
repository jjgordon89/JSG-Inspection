Enter Forms for Assets

Introduction

Forms represent the audits mobile users will preform on an asset. Those forms will be used to collect all of the

infromation about an asset that will be used to generate data in asset reports. Forms must be created by an Admin

and can then be added by any mobile user with the correct permission.

 Add a Category & Class

1. Click  (Your Name)  >  Form Builder .
2. Click  Add Category .
3. Type the name of the new category.
4. Click  Save .
5. Click  Add  beside the category you want to add the class to.
6. Type the name of the new class (this will be the type of asset you want to track).
7. Click  Save .
Now we need to think about the form we want to build that will later be filled out for this type of asset. Using the

example above, I would create a Service Report within the class of Portable Fire Extinguishers.
