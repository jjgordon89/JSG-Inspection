Editing Selections

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you are editing an answer selection list that has already been used on completed forms, you

will want to make sure you are adding and removing new answer options (instead of typing over existing

selections).  If you type over the existing selections, it will change the answers you selected on previously completed

forms.  So only write over an existing answer selection if the meaning of that selection stays the same. For instance,

if you want to change a selection from "Pass" to "Acceptable".

If you delete the answer selection on the list, and add a new one, forms already completed will keep the answer that

was originally selected, and new forms will show the new answer selections you added.

Alternatively, you can create an entirely new list (//docs.inspectall.com/article/513-create-a-new-list-of-answer-

selections), and change the options on each question that you want to reflect the new list.

If you edit the selections on an answer selection list, every question and form template that is using that list will also

be updated.  If you don't want to change other lists, be sure to create a new list instead.

To edit a list of selections on a questions:

1. Make sure form is "Unpublished" so that you can edit it.
2. Click "Edit Question" on the question with the list you'd like to make a change to.
3. Click "Edit Selections"
4. Make your changes to the list (add, remove, edit)
Abbr: An abbreviation of the answer. Set an abbreviation if your user's are viewing the form on the iPhone

or if they are familiar with an already existing abbreviated format on your forms.

Answer: The answer you want available from the list of choices.

Priority: Choose the level of priority you want associated with the answer.

Text Color: The color you want the text of the answer to display as.

Score: For more complicated answers, you may want to have a scoring system. For example, an answer of

"Yes" may give the question 5 points, but an answer of "No" may give 0 points.

Default: The option that the answer should default to during auto-complete.
