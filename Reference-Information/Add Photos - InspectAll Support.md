Add Photos

Photos are an excellent way to draw attention to things you find while answering questions on a form. Adding

pictures will give everyone a better understanding of what is going on during an inspection or audit. Photos can be

taken within the InspectAll app, added from the pictures you have saved to your mobile, or added on the web from a

desktop file.
