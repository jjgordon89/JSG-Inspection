Asset Statuses

Introduction

Asset statuses allow you to setup conditions for your assets. The status of the asset is often associated to the

current state of the asset. For example, common asset status options are Operational, In Repair, and Disposed.

Asset statuses will help keep track of the current condition of an asset, and track how that condition evolves over

time.

Asset Status can be turned on or off for an individual type of asset within the form builder.

Turn on Asset Status for your classes

To ensure that the asset status field is available for your assets, turn it on in Form Builder for each of the classes.

Click the blue pencil edit button beside the class and turn "Asset Status" on.

Then make sure the "On" option is selected under "Asset Status"
