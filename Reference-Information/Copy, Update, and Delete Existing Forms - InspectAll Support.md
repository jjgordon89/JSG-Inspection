Copy, Update, and Delete Existing Forms

Introduction

Forms that you have can always be changed on the web as your process evolves. Once you have a form that works

for you and your users, you can copy it to the same class within the same category. Copying forms will dramatically

cut down on time spent creating a whole new form. In the event your process changes dramatically, or you no longer

need a form, it can be quickly and easily deleted.
