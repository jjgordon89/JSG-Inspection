Updating and Adding Attributes

Introduction

Attributes allow you to collect and store important information on your assets.

For any asset tracking form, you can set up class specific attributes (or details) set up to be collected on your

assets.

And, you are able to add and update attributes for your asset classes/forms right from the Admin menu on the web!

Update or Add Attributes

On the InspectAll website, click on the "Form Builder" option from the drop down menu under your name.

Click on the blue link beside the attribute list you want to update

From here, you can update an attribute or attribute list (lists are found in the "Options" column")

Or add a new attribute by clicking on the green "+Add Attribute" button at the bottom right

Reorder Attributes

You can reorder the attribute lists for a class of assets by clicking and dragging the = icon beside the attribute.

As a standard option, we have a setting that allows the top # of attributes dictated to show on your reports. That

setting will show only the attributes that have been filled in up to the number we set up. You are able to reorder your

attributes in Form Builder so that the attributes you want to show up will be in the proper order. For instance, if you

want the top 10 to show up, reorder your attributes so that the 10 that should populate on the report are first, then let

us know the number you want shown and we will set it up.
