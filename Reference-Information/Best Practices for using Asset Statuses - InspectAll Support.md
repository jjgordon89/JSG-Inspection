Best Practices for using Asset Statuses

Overview

Asset statuses are customizable, and allow you to filter by status in many places across the mobile app and

website.  Setting up and using your asset statuses consistently will help you to easily schedule follow ups for

service.  More information on asset statuses can be found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/92-asset-statuses).

As an Admin user, InspectAll allows you to create as many asset statuses as you want, so you can organize and tag

your customers' assets, or your internal assets, according to the process you use.  Just click on "Asset Statuses"

From there, you can add new statuses, or edit or move existing ones.  Add as many as you want!
