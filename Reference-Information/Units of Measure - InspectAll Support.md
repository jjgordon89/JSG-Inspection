Units of Measure

If you're working within the context of a number question, you have the option to setup various Units of Measure,

which allow you to correlate the given number value to a strongly tied unit.

To edit the units of measure for a question, simply click the button labeled " Edit Units of Measure" displayed in the

image below:

And use the subsequent dialog to Add or Edit your Units of Measure:

Make sure to click I'm Done to make sure your changes are saved! And that's it! The question will now display a

corresponding dropdown picker for units of measure when answering this question on the form.

When entering units of measure on a form (from the mobile app), click on the unit of measure box, and select the

appropriate option.  If you do not select it from the drop down (even if there is only one option), it will not show up on

the PDF report.
