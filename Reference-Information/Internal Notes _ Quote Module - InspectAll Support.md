Internal Notes / Quote Module

Overview

If you want to add notes to a form or inspection job, but don't want those notes to show up on your customers'

reports, there are several options for "Best Practices" to accomplish this.

Quote Module

The first option is the Quote Module. The standard quote module/report can be added to your account at no charge

with the purchase of the professional startup package. If you want changes made the to fields, it's a one-time fee of

$500.

The way this feature is designed to work, is to populate up to 3 additional fields (labeled as you see fit) whenever a

question on a form is answered with any priority other than "good" or "n/a". The information you input is viewable

from within a form on the web, but does not show up on the customer report.

You can also pull a "Quote Worksheet" that will calculate those fields based on the parameters you dictate during

customization. To pull the report, go into the folder on the website, click "Download Report" and choose the "Quote

Report"

The report that populates will show only questions where a priority was entered, the comments, and whatever

values/information you input on those additional fields on the mobile or web.

Form Notes

An alternative option is to utilize your Form Notes to enter internal information. Form notes are found within a form

and are labeled "additional notes". Again, this is internal information that does not show up on your customer report.

Internal Notes Form Template

Another option is to create a form template for internal notes that you don't mark "complete" or that you HIDE

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/837-hide-a-form-template-from-a-report-by-default) as a default. Further instructions

can be found HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/530-how-do-i-omit-a-form-from-a-folder-report).

Utilize Priorities to Hide Questions/Pictures

You can manage what shows up on a report with the priorities. So you can set your folder type preferences (under

Folder Settings on the admin menu) to not show "N/A" priorities and then mark questions you only want to see

internally as an "N/A" priority. Then pictures and answers for those questions won't show up on the report.

Set up your form template to Hide certain Questions by Default

You can set up a question to be "Always Hidden" on any report in Form Builder. That will allow you to have

questions that are by design, internal notes on a form. More information HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/851-

question-visibility).

Folder Notes

Folder notes allow you to choose up to three fields, labeled how you want, to enter internal data for a Job Folder that

doesn't populate on your customer report.  More information HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/790-folder-notes-

internal-job-notes?preview=62b5c05c0b51ec1ae83fa25e).

Folder Description

Folder description is an open text field to enter in notes about a job, instructions to your technician, or any other

information about the job.  It's searchable from the website in the folder grid filters.  More information can be found

HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/629-folder-description).

Account Notes

Account notes allow you to choose up to three fields, labeled how you want, to enter internal data for an Account

that doesn't populate on your customer report.  More information HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/707-account-

notes)

Custom Option

Alternatively, if you want to be able to mark the question with any priority, but it not show up on the report, you can

have a custom report developed, create a question or questions that are for internal notes, mark them with priorities

as you wish, and the custom report will be created to exclude them (it will look for the wording of the question,

basically). https://docs.inspectall.com/article/335-professional-services (//docs.inspectall.com/article/335-
