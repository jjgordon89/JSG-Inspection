Question Visibility on Reports

Report Visibility determines if a question on a form template will always show on the report, always be hidden on a

report, or will follow the default logic set up with the folder settings based on the priority level.

The report visibility option is Question Specific and can be edited by an Admin user on the website in Form Builder.

(//docs.inspectall.com/category/54-form-building)

Default

Default Visibility will follow the logic set up on the Folder Type setting or Form Setting. If you have set up the report

to exclude questions answered with an N/A priority level, for instance, then questions set up with "Default Report

Visibility" will just follow that same logic.

You are able to set up your default preferences in Folder Settings (//docs.inspectall.com/article/83-folder-setup). You

can find that on the Admin menu under your name on the website.

Click on the Blue Pencil icon beside the folder type you want to edit.

Under #2, Report Options, click on the "Forms" tab.

In the section labeled "Only Show Question with the Following Priorities", select which priority levels you want the

report to show by default.

Always Visible

Always Visible allows you to set this question up to show on the report regardless of the priority level you assign it

on an answer. If you want the question to show up even if it is answered with an "N/A" priority level, choose this

visibility setting.

Always Hide

Always Hide will hide the question from your reports regardless of how it is answered. Utilize this setting for

questions that you may want to be internal notes and not show up on your final report presented to the customer.
