Signature Page

A signature page can be added to a folder so that your customers and/or technicians only have to sign once per

job.  This signature page will be added to the folder report output.

To create a signature page, go to Form Builder (//docs.inspectall.com/category/54-form-building) and add a Form

Template under the class for which you want it available.  Make sure you do NOT make it an Asset Tracking form

template (//docs.inspectall.com/article/548-asset-tracking-versus-non-asset-tracking-form-templates) so it's available

without associating a specific asset to it.

Then add your signature question from the question types as well as any other information you want the mobile

user(s) to collect once per job.  Details on adding questions to a form template can be found HERE

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/149-add-questions).

Once you've created your signature page, you can also COPY (//docs.inspectall.com/article/159-can-i-copy-forms-

between-classes) the form template to other classes.

You can also set up your signature page as a DEFAULT (//docs.inspectall.com/article/83-folder-setup) form for any

of your folder types so it will automatically populate when you create a new folder.  That option can be set up in

Folder Settings on the website as an Admin.
