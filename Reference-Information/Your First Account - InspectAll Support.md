Your First Account

Introduction

Accounts allow you to manage your companies, customers, facilities, and/or departments with one simple

applicaiton. Every folder (7-your-first-folder) that is scheduled, form (8-your-first-form) that is completed, or asset (9-

you-first-asset) that's inspected will belong to an account. This association will keep your workflows targeted and

organized.

In a typical "supplier to customer" scenario, an Account represents the customer. The Account Name and

Account ID would correspond to the customer name and customer number.

In a typical "in-house" scenario, an Account represents the facility name or unique business units for your

company. The Account Name and Account ID should correspond to a unique department or facility for your

company.
