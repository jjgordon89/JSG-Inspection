If you want to add more pictures to the asset file, you can do so from the website.  These photos won't show up on

the report, but will be accessible for your mobile users and web users to reference.

More information on that option can be found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/716-asset-files)

You can also see all photos ever taken for an asset on a form using the tool bar. More information on tool bars in

InspectAll can be found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/606-tool-bars-in-inspectall).
