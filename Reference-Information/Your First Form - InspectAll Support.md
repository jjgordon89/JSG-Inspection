Your First Form

Introduction

Forms in InspectAll are just like your paper forms, only faster, smarter, and more useful. Forms capture all of the

answers and responses that your users fill out when they're out in the field. Those responses are used to create

reports.

Forms can be setup to capture the following information:

Answers chosen from available selections

Numbers and measurements

Dates and times

Photos

Barcodes and QR Codes

Signatures

Sketches

Lists

Forms can be enhanced by adding the following:

Default Answers

Comments, Resources, and Files
