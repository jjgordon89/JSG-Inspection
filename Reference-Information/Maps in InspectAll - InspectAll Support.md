Maps in InspectAll

Asset Address

The iOS mobile app will use your Apple device default map application to show you the location of an asset based

on where the last form was completed for that asset.

If a form has previously been completed on an asset, it will tag the coordinates of where the last form was

completed and save that to the asset file.

In the ASSET DETAIL screen, tap "coordinates"

Notes:

Mobile users will want to ensure that they have given the app permission in their device settings to use the device

maps for it to save the coordinate info.

This option will work with whatever map is the default for the mobile device you are using. This function is currently

only available on iOS devices.

Contact Address

You can access a contact on an account, and open your default map application from the address field. Just go into

the account, then the contact, and click on the address field. That will open up whatever you have set up as the

default map application from your device.
