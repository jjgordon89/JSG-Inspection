Auto-Complete Forms and Folders

Auto-Complete or "Pencil-Whipping" Feature

In InspectAll, you can set up a form to where you can automatically fill it out and complete it with the click of a

button.

The first step in setting up the ability to "Auto-Complete" is to set a default answer on any forms you are using.

Instructions can be found here:  https://docs.inspectall.com/article/537-set-a-default-answer

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/537-set-a-default-answer)

Auto Complete a single Form

After you set up the default answer on a form, from the mobile, you can select "Auto-Complete Form" at the top to

automatically answer all questions on that form where a default answer is set.

First, click on the down arrow at the top of a form that has not been marked complete.

Then, choose the option to "Auto-Complete" the questions.

Doing so will mark all questions on the form with the "Default" answer you set up for it in Form Builder.  If you do not

have a default answer set up for a question, it will not be answered with this process.

Auto Complete All forms in a folder

You can also auto-fill and complete all forms in a folder at once.

To do that, follow the same steps as above but from the folder level.
