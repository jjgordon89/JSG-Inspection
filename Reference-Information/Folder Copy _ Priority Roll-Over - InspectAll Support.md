Folder Copy / Priority Roll-Over

Overview

The Folder Copy / Priority Roll-over feature was developed for InspectAll clients who want to see priorities identified

on the last inspection of a specific type, when filling out a new form.  While the initial release of the mobile priority

roll-over is asset specific, the web roll over allows schedulers to roll over issues found on the last inspection or form

for any folder to the new folder so that the mobile user can see it as a reference when they start the new inspection

form.  You can also chose to roll over ALL answers from the previous folder (even those marked with a "good" or

"n/a" priority level), essentially copying and pasting the previous folder into a new one.

For assets, you can also pull an Asset History report (//docs.inspectall.com/article/127-can-i-export-my-asset-

history) on the web, Android, or iOS mobile app to see previous priorities for an asset.

Here's how it works:

Website

The Web version of priority roll over is FOLDER SPECIFIC.  It allows a web or admin user to copy an existing folder

and roll over all priorities found within that folder to the new folder, or all answers from one folder to a new folder.

As an example, you send a technician out to do an annual inspection on an overhead crane, and there was a priority

identified on the hoist the last time someone completed that annual inspection, the priority roll-over feature allows

the web user to roll those priorities found on the hoist on the last annual inspection over to the new folder/forms so

the mobile user can see what happened last time.

To roll over all priorities from a previous folder follow these steps:

* Add Folder
* When you see the option to "Create new" or "Copy Existing", choose "Copy Existing"
* Enter the Folder ID of the folder you want to copy.  And select that folder.
* If you want to roll over ONLY priorities (low, medium, high), then select the "Priorities Only" Box.
* If you want to roll over EVERY answer (good, n/a, low, medium, high), then select the "All Answers" Box.

Details

Priority Roll-Over is currently available on the website to roll over questions marked with a priority for an

entire folder, OR from iOS (Apple mobile devices) and Android to roll over individual priorities, or all priorities on

an asset tracking form, specific to the asset and not the folder.  More information on the mobile option can be

found here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/557-priority-roll-over-feature).

If you have "Always Roll Over" (//docs.inspectall.com/article/861-individual-question-roll-over) set up on a

question on an asset tracking form, the answer will be rolled over to the new folder regardless of priority level.

Rolling over ALL answers from a previous folder is only available from the website. Mobile priority roll-over

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/557-priority-roll-over-feature) is form specific.

From the mobile app, it requires internet access or cellular signal to work, as it is pulling real time

information.

For assets, it is form and asset specific.  If a priority was identified on an asset, then a new form of that

same type will show previously identified priorities regardless of the folder it is added to.  (For instance, from one

annual inspection to the next).

Forms will be copied exactly as they are (if questions have been added or removed on the form template, you

will have the option to refresh the questions on the form to show the changes)

For non-asset forms, it is account/folder specific as well as form specific.  If you copy a folder for an account,

you can choose to roll over the priorities from the last inspection.  And the copy feature will bring all priorities in

the last folder into the new folder, or all answers over from the previous folder depending on the option you

choose.

Only UN-RESOLVED priorities will roll over.  If a priority has been marked resolved anywhere on the web or

mobile app, it will not roll over.

Pictures and signatures do NOT roll over.

Resolution details/notes do NOT roll over.

You can choose to add this feature to your account for use on the Android and Apple mobile app.  If you do,

all mobile users will have access.

Contact us at support@inspectall.com (mailto:support@inspectall.com) to have the feature added to your

account, or if you have additional questions.
