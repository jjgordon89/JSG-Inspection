Create Locations and Areas

Introduction

There are situations in which the same account will have many physical locations, for this reason we allow you to

associate multiple locations to an account. Assigning locations to an account will take the guess work out of

determining where attention is needed.

Take it even one step further! To make servicing an account even easier, InspectAll allows you to break each

location into several areas.
