Get Started Using Assets

Introduction

Assets represent things such as pieces of equipment, persons, buildings, or tools that you want to track and

manage using InspectAll. Assets can be setup to capture the following information:

Images

Serial Number, Barcode and QR codes

Custom Attributes (such as size or capacity)

Urgent Notes

Statuses

Before you can add your first asset, you will need to setup and configure the asset types. Asset types are organized

by categories and classes. For example, I may call my category Fire Protection and Prevention and place the

different types of equipment I want to track in a class inside that category. Below I have a category called Fire

Protection and Prevention with 3 different types of assets (or classes) I want to track:

Fire Protection and Prevention

Portable Fire Extinguishers

Automatic Sprinkler Systems

Fire Extinguishing Systems

Detection and Alarm Systems

Once your asset types are created, you will create forms to guide your users through the inspections of the asset.

The information the users collect will provide you and your customers with real time information that highlights what

is being done correctly, and where there is room for improvement.
