Tool Bars in InspectAll

Overview

From the InspectAll website, as a Web or Admin user, you are able to see information as it happens (Dashboard), by

Scheduled Date (Calendar), by Account (Accounts), Job/Event (Folders), or Asset (Assets).

When looking at information by Account, Folder, or Asset, you have access to a toolbar within each, that allows you

to dig even deeper into the information.
