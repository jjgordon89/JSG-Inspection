Brand Your Reports

Introduction

We know how important branding and public confidence in your brand is. InspectAll provides settings that allow you

to tweak your company settings and make an InspectAll all your own. Customizing reports will make them appear to

customers as though they came directly from you. In your InspectAll account, you can add your logo, add

disclaimers, and change report settings to reflect the information you need.

Update Address

To update the address that shows on your report header, click on "Report Branding" under your name on the

website admin menu and then click on the box with your address.

Add A Header Logo

Your company’s brand is its value. Upload your logo and it will appear in the header of all of your printed reports in

InspectAll. To upload a logo:

1. Click  (Your Name)    at the top right and choose   Report Branding  within the web app
(http://app/inspectall.com).

2. In the Branding page, move your cursor over the  Photo Square  and click.
3. In your browsers file finder, select the image you want to upload as your logo.
4. Use a small sized logo for it to look best on the top of each report page. For sizing, if you think about a standard
sheet of paper, you can size them accordingly (based on an 8.5 x 11" sheet of paper), approximately 250-300px.

File types supported are .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, and .bmp.
