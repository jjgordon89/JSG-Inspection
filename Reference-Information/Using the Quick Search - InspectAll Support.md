The quick search is a great tool to quickly find an Account, Folder, Asset, or Form.

To use it, log in to the InspectAll website, and type in the search criteria in the box at the top right.  Then click on the

appropriate search result from the drop down.

For Accounts:  Type in the Account ID or Account Name
