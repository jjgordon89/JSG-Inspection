Folder Files

Overview

Folder Files allow you to attach documents to a folder that are viewable from the InspectAll website and on iOS and

Android devices.

Some of the more common uses for these folder files are to store purchase orders for a job, invoices, work orders,

repair quotes, or anything related to the job folder that you want to be able to access in one place.  It's a great

feature to help you organize your efforts and find related information quickly.

How to Use it

To use the Folder File feature, simply go into the folder, and click on the little green plus icon to the left side.  When

you click on the icon, your document window will populate allowing you to select the file you want to attach from

your computer.

After you select the file you want to add, it will show up under the "Files" section in your folder.  You can click on the

blue pencil icon to edit the file and rename it or add a description.
