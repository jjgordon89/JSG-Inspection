Scoring

Overview

InspectAll allows you to add a weight to single-select and multi-selection answers and then get an automatic score

populated on your reports.

How to set it Up

In Form Builder, go into the form template you want to edit and un-publish it.

From there, go to one of your single-select or multi-select answer lists and edit your question.  Or create a new

question on the form template if you are building your form.  Click here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/149-add-

questions) for more information on adding questions.

If you aren't using single-select or multi-select answer lists, read here (//docs.inspectall.com/article/513-create-

a-new-list-of-answer-selections) to find out how to create a new answer selection list.

Once in the edit function of the question, click on "Edit List" to edit the current answer selection list, or "Manage

Lists" to create a new one or edit a different list. More information on editing selections can be found here

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/230-editing-selections).

Update the score for each answer selection.  There's no need to add a score for "Not Applicable" priority levels

as they automatically are excluded from the scoring calculations. Questions that aren't answered are also

excluded from the calculation.  For example, if you have 10 questions, and only 8 of them are answered, then

scoring will be based on the scores only for those 8 questions.

Add it to Reporting

Once you have set up your scoring, contact us (http://www.inspectall.com/contact).  We will need to know on which

form template(s) you need the scoring to show up in reporting. It's a feature we need to turn on from our end.
