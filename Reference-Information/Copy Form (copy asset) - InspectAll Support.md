Copy Form (copy asset)

This article details how to copy a form to a new asset (essentially copying the asset), or to the same asset within a

folder.  These instructions detail how to copy the form itself, and not the Form Template.  To copy the form template,

you must have Admin access and complete the copy from the website in Form Builder. Copy Form TEMPLATE

5. Enter a prefix/Serial Number/Suffix to be applied in sequence to the new assets you create. Note: This
information can be updated later in the individual asset file or the asset details within the form on the mobile

app.

6. Click "Copy Form" to copy the form into the folder.
Refresh Your Forms

1. If you have already added forms to a folder, and then done some editing to the form template or the asset
attributes where logic is associated, you will want to REFRESH the form template to see the changes on that

form in a folder.

2. After adding or deleting questions from your form template and publishing the new version, go into the form
template you want to update. If you are on the mobile app, you will first need to do a sync.

3. At the top right you will see a red number beside the "Refresh" option.  Click "Refresh" to see the updates.
4. Note:  If you do NOT want your form template changes to affect a previously created form in a folder, do not
Refresh the form.  That will leave previously completed forms as they were when they were filled out.
