Advanced tips for Asset setup

Introduction

If you want to configure the asset further, we have a few options that can be setup differently for each asset type.

Applying these details to your assets will allow you to focus the direction of your inspections. With InspectAll you can

create default attributes, custom attributes, and exclusions.

Add Default Attributes

Default Attributes are searchable attributes that are used to find, identify, and organize assets. Use default attributes

for things like Serial Numbers, Unique Identifiers, Barcodes, and QR Codes. To edit default attributes:

1. Find the Asset Class in the forms list under Form Builder (https://app.inspectall.com/v4/#form_templates)
2. Click the "Edit Class" pencil icon on the class row:
3. Edit the following as desired:
ID 1 Name: This field is used for searching assets. For example, if you had a Person as the Class, you may

set the ID 1 field as "First Name". You can also set the ID 1 field as "Required" or "Not Required" for your

user's. (50 character limit)

ID 2 Name: This field can be used for searching assets. For example, if you had a Person as the Class

Name / Asset, you may set the ID 2 field as "Employee ID". You can also choose to just "Hide" ID 2 all

together by choosing "Hide". (50 character limit)

Urgent Note: On / Off: Showing an urgent note allows users to add a note to the asset that will alert all

users when viewing the asset.  An example would be "Disconnect power before inspection!"

Asset Status: On / Off: Showing a status allows users to assign a status to the asset.  If you do not want to

track statuses for this class of asset, turn it off.

4. Click  Update Class .
Add Custom Attributes

Custom Attributes identify characteristics about the Assets that you're tracking. You can capture Custom Attributes

with a text (number,date,time), picker, or a free text picker option. Custom Attributes are not searchable fields from

the quick search, but they can be used to filter down a list of assets when adding assets to a folder or when viewing

assets in a list and for Reports and Analytics. Use Custom Attributes to capture Model Numbers, Dates of

Manufacture, Custom Components, Asset Details, and much more. To edit custom attributes:

1. Find the Asset Class in the forms list under Form Builder (https://app.inspectall.com/v4/#form_templates)
2. Click the "Setup Attributes" or "X Attributes" link on the asset class row (see "6 Attribute" link on this Portable
Fire Extinguisher below):

3. From the attributes modal you can add/edit the attributes:

4. Enter the following information as desired:
Name: The name of the attribute. For example, you may want to collect the asset's Manufacturer, Height,

Weight Capacity, or DOM. (100 character limit)

QuestionType: Choose which type of answer you want for the attribute. For example, a Manufacturer may

require a picker (a list of Manufacturer's to choose from) while Capacity may allow for free form answers

(free text).

Required: Make the attribute required.

All Caps: Check if you want the answer to display in all capitalized letters (for text question types only).

5. Just tab out of the field you made the change to in order to commit the change and save.
6. For selections after adding a picker or free text picker:
Click on the link labeled "0 Selections" beside the new attribute in order to add selections for the user to

choose from.

Add as many selections as you want by clicking the  Add Row  button.

Fill out the name of the Attribute Option. For example, if I had "Height" as an attribute, I may add an answer

like stepladder, 12 foot, 16 foot, 20 foot.

Exclude Questions by Attribute

You can Exclude Questions from any asset form based on answers given for custom attributes (picker and free text

picker only). When excluded questions are setup, the questions on a form are shown or hidden based on your

answer to the custom attribute. Use excluded questions to remove questions from forms that don't pertain to a

specific type or configuration of assets. To exclude questions:

1. Work your way back into the selections list for a particular attribute
2. Click  Exclude 0 Questions when Selected  for the attribute option where you would like to exclude questions.
3. Select the questions to be excluded based on this attribute option being chosen.
4. Click  I'm done
