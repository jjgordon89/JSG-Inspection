Add a Form

Introduction

Forms capture all of the questions and responses that your users will fill out when using InspectAll. Those reponses

are used to generate your reports. Forms are created in the form builder, and are organized by category and class

to make them easy to find. Adding forms to your folders is a fast and easy way to organize and/or assign jobs.

Forms can be setup to capture the following information:

Single and Multiple Choice Selections

Text, Date, and Number Values

Images & Annotations

Barcodes and QR Codes

Signatures

Sketches

Lists

Tables

Forms can be enhanced by adding the following:

Form Instructions

Default Answers

Comments, Resources, and Files

Formulas

Scores
