Update the Schedule

Introduction

If the dates you want work done on a folder change, you can always go back and edit the schedule. Editing the

schedule as changes arise is another way to make sure everyone has all the right resources when they are

needed.  You are also able to add users to an already scheduled folder.

You can also allow users on the same team to SHARE a folder with another member of their team from their mobile

device.

To allow users to share folders from the mobile, they must be on the same TEAM.  You can create teams as an

admin, and users can be assigned to as many teams as they want. More about setting up TEAMS can be found

here:  https://docs.inspectall.com/article/99-team-setup (//docs.inspectall.com/article/99-team-setup)

1.  Once users are on the same team (and a sync is done after the team set up is complete), they will be able to
share a folder that is scheduled to them to another user on their team.

2.  Tap on the Folder tab to get to Folder Details
3.  Then down below the Schedule Details, they will see a list of other members of their team.  They can click on the
user they want to share with.  When they do a sync, and the other user does a sync, the folder will be shared.
