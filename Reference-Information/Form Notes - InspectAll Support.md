Form Notes

Overview

Form notes serve as internal notes that are specific to a form.  These notes can be viewed by the mobile user from

the app, as well as from an admin or web user on the website.  Form notes allow up to 500 characters and are

searchable on the website in the Folder Search.

Best Practice Uses

Form notes can be used for a variety of purposes to include instructions for the mobile user, individual form work

order numbers, or notes from the mobile user to the admin.  Use them to indicate which user should complete a

form (useful when you have multiple users working on the same folder), service call instructions (what should be

repaired on a particular form/asset), or even to list parts needed or used that you don't want to show up on the

customer's folder report.

How to Enter Form Notes

Form notes can be entered within a form on the app or website by going into the form and then into the "Form

Details".
