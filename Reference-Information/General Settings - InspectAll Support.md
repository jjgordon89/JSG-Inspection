admin users to assign accounts to the 'All Users' team."

Use the mobile settings to keep mobile devices data usage as small as possible. During a sync, your device

downloads all of the forms and folders within your schedule window, the less data you have in your schedule

window the faster syncing will be. Once a folder falls outside of the schedule window it will no longer display on the

mobile device, but don't worry it is saved and is accessible on the web. To get a folder back on your mobile device

you'll simply need to reschedule a folder (/articles/update-the-schedule).

 Update the Sync Window

1. Click  Your Name  >  General Settings .
2. Click the first box to update how many days in the past folders should show to mobile users.
3. Click the second box to update how many days folders scheduled in the future should display to mobile users.
4. Click  Update General Settings .
