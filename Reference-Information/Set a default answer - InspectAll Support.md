Set a default answer

You can set up a default answer selection in Form Builder.  Default answers will allow you to use the "Auto-

Complete Questions" feature on your mobile device.

From Form builder, go into the Form Template, and un-publish it.

Click the blue pencil to edit the question.

Then click on "Edit Selections" from below the list of selections drop down.

You can set up your default answer for that selection list from here.  Select the answer that you want set as your

default and then click "Update Selections".

Keep in mind that answers are set by answer selection list.  So if you are using the same list on multiple questions,

and only want the default set up for some, you will want to create another list that has a default assigned.

Set Default answers based on a Canned Comment

(//docs.inspectall.com/article/152-add-comments-resources-and-files)

You can set up a question to select an answer based on the canned comment you choose. For instance, if you

choose the canned comment "Breaks are bad", it can be set up to automatically answer the question with a "Fail".
