Organize with Categories and Classes

Introduction

As you begin to build form templates, you’ll want to keep them organized. The form builder structures your form

templates into categories and classes. When you're finished, your setup may look something like what you see

below:

In the screen shot below, you will see what each row represents.

In this example, the CATEGORY is "Fall Protection".  The category is the section that appears in the Gray Bars in

Form builder.

Under the CATEGORY of "Fall Protection" are multiple CLASSES.  The CLASSES are

Full Body Harness, Hooks-Caribiners, Lanyards, Self Retracting Lifelines, Tie-Off Adaptors.

Under each CLASS, you can have multiple form templates.

Attributes will be specific to a CLASS of asset

Categories

Categories are the highest level of organization when you're building form templates. Once you create a category,

you’ll simply need to give it a Name. Remember that your Forms are going to be organized into classes and

categories, so try to create an outline that's flexible but not overly deconstructed.   There's no real magic to

categories - you can have one or many. Categories are primarily built to help with navigating the application. Always

try to have a category with multiple classes underneath it.

Here’s a few good examples of category names:

Workplace Exposures & Protections

Fire Protection & Prevention

Safety

Quality

Ergonomics

Buildings and Equipment

Material Handling

1. Click  (Your Name)  >  Form Builder .
2. Click  Category Options .

Classes

Classes are the glue that holds your form templates together under categories. Classes fit between the category

and form templates, and you can have one or many form templates in each class. You can improve the organization

of your classes by adding an icon to the class that is a visual representation of the assets, forms, or process that

class outlines.

Classes enable asset tracking which allows all of the relevant identifiers, attributes, question exclusions, and form

templates for assets. You can also use classes to easily group form templates that don't track assets also.

Here’s a few good examples of class names:

Category: Workplace Exposures

Machine Guarding

Lock Out / Tag out - Energy Control

Personal Protective Equipment

Sanitation

 Add a Class

1. Click  (Your Name)  >  Form Builder .
2. Click  +  beside the category you want to add the class to.
3. Type the name of the new class, upload an icon, and decide whether this class will  Track Assets .
4. If you selected to  Track Assets , fill in the additional fields for ID1 Name, ID2 Name, Asset Status settings, and
Urgent Note settings.

5. Click  Create Class .
