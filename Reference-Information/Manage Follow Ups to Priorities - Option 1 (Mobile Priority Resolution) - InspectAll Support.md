Manage Follow Ups to Priorities - Option 1 (Mobile

Priority Resolution)

Overview

InspectAll allows you to follow a priority from finding to resolution.  The following instructions detail another great

option in managing the resolution of priorities found on an inspection form, for example, and following it through to

the service call/repair stage.  This option details the use of the "Mobile Priority Resolution" feature.

Assign Priorities from the Mobile

The best practice is to instruct the field technicians to ASSIGN any question/priority found (that needs a follow up) to

the Admin or scheduler.

To do that, they will only need to click on the “Assigned To” option in a question on the mobile, and then select the

Admin User Name from the drop down list.

They can also enter details about what needs to be done in the notes section below the “Resolve Due” field.

See Priorities assigned to you on the web or from your mobile device

Once the technician has done a sync on the mobile, the Admin or Scheduler can easily see all outstanding

(unresolved) issues that have been assigned to them from the website.  Other users can see issues assigned to

them from the mobile with the "My Priorities" feature.  Click here to learn more. (//docs.inspectall.com/article/565-

From the web:

Click on the “Priorities” tab

Click on the “Assigned to Me” filter option on the left hand side to filter

Manage Resolutions from the Website

Once the scheduler has filtered the priorities to show only those assigned to them, they can also manage resolution

from this same screen.  Just click on the blue “Edit” pencil, and enter in the details.

Click “Resolved” and then “Update Priority,” when done, to move the priority to the “Resolved” tab (and out of the list

of items to address).

Manage Resolutions from the Mobile App

You can resolve priorities within a Folder on the Mobile app.  Just tap on the form with Priorities, and go into any

questions where priorities have been found.  You can do a FILTER by PRIORITIES first if you want, to get right to

the list of questions where a low, medium, or high priority has been marked.

Get Notifications

You can also set up your notification preferences to receive an email whenever a priority is assigned to you.  To do

that, click on your name at the top right on the website, and choose “My Profile” from the drop down menu.

Under “My Email Notifications,” click the green “Add Notification” button.

You can then select the frequency of the notifications, and set the parameters.

If you want to get notified only on those priorities that are assigned to you from the mobile, be sure to check that

box.
