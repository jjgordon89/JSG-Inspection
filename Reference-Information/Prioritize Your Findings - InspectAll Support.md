Prioritize Your Findings

Introduction

Priorities highlight things that are good, and draw attention to things that need attention. Every question has an area

where you can select the priority of your answer. The available choices are

NA

Good

Low

Medium

High

Once a priority has been selected, you can use the text box to suggest ways to resolve the priority. Many graphs,

tables, and reports from InspectAll are calculated based on the priority selected.

If a question has a priority of Low, Medium, or High, an area will appear below the priority that allows you to resolve

the priority. You can use the text box to explain the steps you took to resolve the priority.
