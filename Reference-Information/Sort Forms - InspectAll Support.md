Sort Forms

Overview

From within a folder (on the web, Apple App, or Android App) you can reorder the forms, sorting them by different

parameters.  You can also reorder forms on the downloaded report.

Re-ordering forms on the Website

From within the folder, click on the "Sort" button under "Forms".

Choose from Newest, Oldest, Recently Completed, Incompleted, Location Name, Form Template Name, Asset ID1,

Asset ID2, or Total Priorities Found.

Note, this sort is for viewing only.  Sorting forms from here will not reorder the forms on the report.   Nor does it

actually "Reorder" them or "Change their Ordinals".

To reorder the forms on the report, click on "Download Report" from within the folder and choose your sort order

from there. When you "Download" the folder report you are given the option to "Reorder" the forms which actually

does set the ordinals and reorder them the same as the mobile does.

Re-ordering forms on Apple App

You can re-order your forms by Date Completed, Location, Form Type, Asset ID1, Asset ID2, or Priorities.  You can

also tap and hold on the "Move" icon at the top of a form, and manually order the forms as you want. These

changes will only sort the VIEW of the forms you see in the folder on the mobile app.

On an iPhone

From within the folder, click on "Sort" at the bottom right.

Additional Details:   Each Form has an "Ordinal" value inside a folder (1, 2, 3, 4). The standard folder report

follows this ordering.

On iOS you can reorder forms by dragging and dropping them which updates those ordinals Or on Mobile

you can "Reorder" the forms based on some property (Priorities, Date Completed...). This literally just

changes the "Ordinals" of the forms to order them according to your property at that moment. So if after you

order them by "Priorities" then the last form in that folder gets 20 more priorities found on it then they would

need to manually be "Reordered" again to calculate and set the ordinals. This is why it's best to "Reorder" a

folder when you're done and about to print it. For "Default Forms" they will be added in the order that they are

setup in the Folder Settings. So if you setup the default forms in the folder in the order of "Form1, Form2,

Form3" then they will get ordinals 1, 2, 3 as you would expect.
