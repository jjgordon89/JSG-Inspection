What are Accounts and how many can I use?

Accounts are companies, customers, facilities, and/or departments that you plan to manage using InspectAll. Every

folder that is dispatched, form that is completed, or asset (/articles/your-first-asset) inspected will be associated with

an account. This association will keep your workflows targeted and organized.

In a typical "supplier to customer" scenario, an Account represents the customer. The Account Name and

Account ID would correspond to the customer name and customer number.

In a typical "in-house" scenario, an Account represents the facility name of unique business units for your company.

The Account Name and Account ID should correspond to unique departments or facilities for your company.

There is no limit to the number of accounts that you can add.
