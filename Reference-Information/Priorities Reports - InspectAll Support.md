Priorities Reports

Reporting on Priorities

In InspectAll, all findings are categorized by the priority level assigned during an inspection.  You can assign a "Low,

Medium, or High" priority to any issue you find.  If no issue is found, a "Good" priority level is assigned, and if the

question isn't applicable, then an "N/A" priority will be assigned.

Utilizing these priority levels allows you to customize your folder reports, notifications, and also review priority

findings by account, folder, asset, or date range.

Priorities by Account

To see all priorities found by account, go to your account tab on the web, and find the account for which you want to

review priorities, and go into that Account.

Once in the Account, you will see all priorities ever identified on any form completed for that account.

You can filter these by "Resolved" or "Unresolved" by tapping on the appropriate button above the listing.

You can also DOWNLOAD a priorities report that will populate in Excel.
