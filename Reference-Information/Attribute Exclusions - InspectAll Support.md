Attribute Exclusions

Add Exclusions

Hiding questions based on a user's answers is a great way to speed up filling out forms. It also prevents users from

mistakenly answering non-relevant questions. We allow questions to be hidden based on answers given when filling

out asset attributes.

For example, say you created a form to inspect a piece of machinery. You may have an attribute that asks you the

following:

Frequency of Use

Not in Use

Seldom

Frequent

Heavy

If the user says your piece of machinery has a "Heavy" frequency of use, you will more than likely ask more

questions than if the piece of machinery were "Not in Use". When "Not in Use" is chosen, you will just setup the

questions to be excluded from the form.
