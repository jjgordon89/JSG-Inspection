Annotate Resource Image File

InspectAll allows you to add resource image files to questions on a form template that are accessible for your mobile

users to view as a reference from their mobile app. You can read more about how to set that option up in Form

Builder HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/152-add-comments-resources-and-files).

The annotation features allows you to insert an image resource file as a picture for a question so that you can

annotated it. This feature is helpful wanting to annotate a standard diagram on a form template.

How To Use It

After adding the resource image to the form template (instructions in the link above), you will be able to see if a

question ha

s resource files attached to it on the mobile app. If it does, it will show a number that indicates the number of

resources available for that question. Tap the "comments and resources" option to view them.
