Start Customizing InspectAll

Introduction

We know how important branding and public confidence in your brand is. InspectAll provides settings that allow you

to tweak your company settings and make an InspectAll all your own. Customizing reports will make them appear to

customers as though they came directly from you. In your InspectAll account, you can add your logo, add

disclaimers, and change report settings to reflect the information you need.

 Add A Logo

Your company’s brand is it's value. Upload your logo and it will appear in the header of all of your printed reports in

InspectAll. To upload a logo:

2. In the Branding page, move your cursor over the  Photo Square  and click.
3. In your browsers file finder, select the image you want to upload as your logo.
 Add a Footer

Add a custom confidentiality notice or legal disclaimer to the bottom of your reports to protect your company and

your data. The custom text you add will appear in the report's footer and will be printed on every report from

InspectAll.

The Footer allows for a maximum of 1,000 characters in length. To add a report footer:

1. Click  (Your Name)  >  Branding  in the web app (https://app.inspectall.com).
