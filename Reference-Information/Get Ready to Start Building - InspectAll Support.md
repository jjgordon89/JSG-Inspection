Get Ready to Start Building

Forms capture all of the questions and responses that your users will fill out when using InspectAll. Those

responses are used to create downloadable reports. Forms are created in the form builder, and are organized by

category and class to make them easy to find.

Forms can be setup to capture the following information:

Single and Multiple Choice Questions

Text and Number Values

Dates and Time

Images and Annotations

Barcodes and QR Codes

Signatures

Sketches

Lists

Tables
