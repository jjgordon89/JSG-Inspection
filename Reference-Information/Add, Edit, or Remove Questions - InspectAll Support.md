Add, Edit, or Remove Questions

Introduction

The most important part of the form is the questions themselves. InspectAll allows for a wide variety of types of

questions because there is a wide variety of information you need. Questions within the form are organized under

headings. Each question added will allow a user to input an answer, add comments, photos, and other resources to

the question.

Each question you create will have the following properties:

Question: The question or instructions you want the user to respond to with an answer.

Definition: Any extra information that may help the user in answering the question.

Required: If a question is marked required, the mobile user will not be able to complete the form until all

required questions are answered.

Some questions have extra options depending on the type of question.

Default Value: (All questions except Signature & Sketch) This can be used as an example answer to assist the

user in answering the question.

Answer List: (Only Multi-Select and Single-Select questions) This is used as the list of available answers for

the user to choose from. Each answer list you create will have the following properties:

List Name: The name of the answer list (not visible to the user when filling out the form). A list that contained

Pass, Fail, and Not Applicable as the available answers may have a list name of "Pass / Fail / NA".

Share to All Forms / This Form Only: Sharing to all forms makes the answers list available to all forms. Use

this for generic answer lists like "Grade 1 - 10". Sharing to this form only will restrict the list to the current form

you are building. Use this for specific answer lists like "Tire Pressure Low / Tire Pressure OK".

Answers: These will be the available answers to choose from on the question. Each answer can have the

following properties:

Abbr: An abbreviation of the answer. Set an abbreviation if your user's are viewing the form on the iPhone or if

they are familiar with an already existing abbreviated format on your forms.

Answer: The answer you want available from the list of choices.

Priority: Choose the level of priority you want associated with the answer.

Text Color: The color you want the text of the answer to display as.

Score: For more complicated answers, you may want to have a scoring system. For example, an answer of

"Yes" may give the question 5 points, but an answer of "No" may give 0 points.

Default: The option that the answer should default to during auto-complete.

After creating your question, you can add additional helpful resources to that question.

Canned Comment: Save comments so that they will be available on everyone's question to use and save for

later.

Resources: Text information that will be available to the user for viewing when answering the question.

Files: You can upload files and images that will be viewable to the user when answering the question.

Report Visibility

Report Visibility determines if a question on a form template will always show on the report, always be hidden on a

report, or will follow the default logic set up with the folder settings based on the priority level.

The report visibility option is Question Specific and can be edited by an Admin user on the website in Form Builder.

Default

Default Visibility will follow the logic set up on the Folder Type setting or Form Setting. If you have set up the report

to exclude questions answered with an N/A priority level, for instance, then questions set up with "Default Report

Visibility" will just follow that same logic.

Always Visible

Always Visible allows you to set this question up to show on the report regardless of the priority level you assign it

on an answer. If you want the question to show up even if it is answered with an "N/A" priority level, choose this

visibility setting.

Always Hide

Always Hide will hide the question from your reports regardless of how it is answered. Utilize this setting for

questions that you may want to be internal notes and not show up on your final report presented to the customer.

Add a Heading

The headings are used to group questions on the form. Adding a heading is the first step to building a form.
