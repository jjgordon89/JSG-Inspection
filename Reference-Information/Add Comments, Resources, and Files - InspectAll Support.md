Add Comments, Resources, and Files

Introduction

You can add several resources, files, and even commonly used comments to each question on a form. Utilizing

these tools will cut down on the amount of time you spend filling out a form on your mobile device. Comments, files,

and resources are customized to fit your specific needs.

You can enter canned comments and resources specific to the question.

First, let's define what each of these additional areas means and what we recommend for each area.

Canned Comments: This is where you should write commonly used comments given to the question. You can

even associate a specific answer to a canned comment. When the user answers the question, they will be able

to choose a canned comment and have it pre-fill the comment field with that canned comment.

Resources: This is where you should write any reference material, procedures, or regulations that are relevant

to the question being asked. When the user answer the question, they will be able to read any relevant

resources and even add a resource to the comment field.

Files: This is where you should add any images, pdfs, or word documents relevant to the question. This feature

can be used to display schematics, manufacturer manuals, dimension tables, or any other diagrams to every

user who answers the question. By default, resource files are only available to view if the mobile user is online

(wifi or cell signal). If you want the resource images available offline, you will need to change that setting in the

main menu. Instructions HERE (//docs.inspectall.com/article/453-question-files-offline-sync).

To annotate the resource file (image file types only), a user can insert it into a question after viewing it and use the

annotation tools the same as they would on a picture taken on a question. More details HERE
